# SVHN Digit Recognition - Generative AI and Computer Vision
SVHN Digit Recognition project


### Context:
One of the most interesting tasks in deep learning is to recognize objects in natural scenes. The ability to process visual information using machine learning algorithms can be very useful as demonstrated in various applications.

The SVHN dataset contains over 600,000 labeled digits cropped from street-level photos. It is one of the most popular image recognition datasets. It has been used in neural networks created by Google to improve the map quality by automatically transcribing the address numbers from a patch of pixels. The transcribed number with a known street address helps pinpoint the location of the building it represents.

 

### Objective:
Our objective is to predict the number depicted inside the image by using Artificial or Fully Connected Feed Forward Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. We will go through various models of each and finally select the one that is giving us the best performance. 

 

### Dataset:
The [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YoTWTdShWdI55SmBp4Ie2IkaI_E3Gmp0/view) is present in .h5 format. in order to save ourselves a lot of computation time.

### Key takeaways:
This project explores the application of Generative AI and Computer Vision techniques using Keras and TensorFlow frameworks to predict digits within SVHN images. It encompasses the implementation of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), each tested with different configurations such as regularization techniques, varying numbers of layers, and filter sizes. The project culminates in the selection of the best-performing model based on accuracy, demonstrating effective strategies in image recognition and paving the way for advanced applications in visual data analysis.
